The prblenms solved in this lab journal illustrate a wide range of fundamental programming concepts. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is central, with classes like Complex, House, and Student showcasing encapsulation, constructors, destructors, and operator overloading (e.g., +, =, and * for complex number arithmetic). Templates enable generic programming, as seen in the GetMax function and the mypair class, which work with any data type. File handling is demonstrated using ifstream and ofstream to read from and write to files, with error handling to ensure file operations are robust. Dynamic memory management is highlighted in the Student class, where a dynamically allocated array stores grades, and the destructor ensures proper cleanup. Arrays and loops are used extensively for storing and iterating over data, such as houses or student records. I/O manipulation techniques like setw, setprecision, and fixed are employed for formatted output, while cin and getline handle user input. Pointers and references are used for dynamic memory allocation and modifying objects directly. Mathematical operations include complex number arithmetic, averages, and comparisons (e.g., finding the highest and lowest student averages). String manipulation is used for reading and formatting text, and control structures like if, else, and loops handle decision-making and iteration. The code also leverages the C++ Standard Library, including headers like <iostream>, <fstream>, <iomanip>, and <string>, along with functions like isspace, isalpha, and sqrt. Together, these concepts form the backbone of C++ programming, enabling the creation of efficient, modular, and reusable code for real-world applications.
