Today, we implemented a Stack class in C++ using a dynamic array and applied it to three key problems: validity of a parenthesized expression, infix to postfix conversion, and postfix evaluation. We properly structured the code by separating declarations in stack.h, definitions in stack.cpp, and execution in driver.cpp, ensuring clean and maintainable code. The stack efficiently handled expression validation, operator precedence, and mathematical evaluations, making the solutions both robust and reusable. This structured approach enhances clarity, efficiency, and scalability for future modifications.
